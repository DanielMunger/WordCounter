|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------|
| User enters a string of length one to find, and a matching sentence to be found in. Instances is returned.                                                 | Find: 'a' In: 'a'                     | Instances: 1 ~This test allows me to verify the inputs are being read correctly without performing any modifiers on them. |
| User enters a single word of identical characters, and a sentence with a matching word at the beginning of the sentence. Instances is returned             | Find: 'ccc' In: 'ccc ddd eee'         | Instances: 1 ~ This test allows me to verify that an inputted string of any length is able to be compared. |
| User enters a single word of identical characters and a sentence with a matching word anywhere in the sentence. Instances is returned.                     | Find: 'fff' In: 'abd fff crc'         | Instances: 1 ~ This test verifies that I am able to search anywhere in the inputted sentence to find a single instance of the inputted word.|
| User enters a single word of different characters, and a sentence with a matching word at the beginning of the sentence. Instances is returned.            | Find: 'the' In: 'the cat in a hat'    | Instances: 1 ~ This test allows me to check that a multiple character word is able to be found. Without this, my function would be rather useless. |
| User enters a single word of different characters, and a sentence with a matching word anywhere in the sentence. Instances is returned.                    | Find: 'the' In: 'a cat in the hat.'   | Instances: 1 ~ This test is the most important. It demonstrates that a word can be found anywhere in the sentence and counted. |
| User enters a single word of different characters, and a sentence with several matches anywhere in the sentence. Instances is returned.                    | Find: 'the' In: 'the cat in the hat.' | Instnaces: 2 ~ An extension of the previous test, this verifies that my method of finding a word returns all instances and not just a single instance. A key spec. |
| User enters a single word of different characters, and a sentence with several matches  anywhere in the sentence. Instances is returned, case-insensitive. | Find: 'The' In: 'thE cat in tHe hat.' | Instances: 2 ~ This test is unnecessary for the MVP but is a good fail-safe to make sure the user doesn't make any mistakes upon entry. |
| User enters a single word of different characters, and a sentence that includes punctuation and symbols. Instances is returned.          | Find: 'cat' In: 'The? Cat, in the hat! ' | Instances: 1 ~This test is necessary in order to make sure my program can handle any type of inputted text(that is within reason). |
